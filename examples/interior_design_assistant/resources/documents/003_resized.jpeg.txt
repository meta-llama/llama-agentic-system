The fireplace in this photo is a sleek, modern design with a rectangular shape and a black frame. The firebox is made of glass, allowing for a clear view of the flames, and features a black metal surround that complements the gray stone wall. The fire is burning brightly, with yellow and orange flames rising from the logs. The overall style of the fireplace is contemporary and minimalist, with clean lines and a focus on functionality. The use of gray stone for the wall and black metal for the surround creates a cohesive and sophisticated look, while the glass firebox adds a touch of elegance and modernity.
